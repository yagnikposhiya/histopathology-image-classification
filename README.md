# histopathology-image-classification
This repository contains python scripts for histopathology image classification written with the help of the PyTorch framework.

# Dataset
[Chaoyang Dataset](https://bupt-ai-cz.github.io/HSA-NRL/)
* Chaoyang dataset contains **1111** normal, **842** serrated, **1404** adenocarcinoma, **664** adenoma, and **705** normal, **321** serrated, **840** adenocarcinoma, **273** adenoma samples for training and testing, respectively. (Notes: **"0"** means normal, **"1"** means serrated, **"2"** means adenocarinoma, and **"3"** means adenoma in our dataset files.)
* Total (Training-Testing combine) Images: **6160**
